The transformer is a standard architecture for building large language models. A transformer has three major components:

1. [Input Encoding Component](/readings/input-encoding-component)
2. [Transformer Blocks](/readings/transformer-blocks)
3. [Language Modeling Head](/readings/language-modeling-head)

The following diagram shows the block diagram of a transformer architecture for language modeling:
